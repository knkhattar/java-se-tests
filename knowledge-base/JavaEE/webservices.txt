***WHAT ARE DIFFERENT TYPE OF WEB SERVICES
 a. soap(Simple Object Access Protocol)
 b. Rest (Representational State Transfer)
 
.STEPS TO IMPLEMENT A RESTFUL WEB SERVICE

.ECLIPSE - STEPS TO IMPEMENT A SOAP BASED WEB SERVICE
 1. Create a new dynamic web project
 2. Create a package and hello world bean inside
 3. Right click on project->new->web service
 4. Provide the Web service type and implementation bean qualified name.
 5. click finish - Eclipse creates test client also.
 
 .JAX-WS - STEPS TO IMPLEMENT A SOAP BASED WEB SERVICE
 
 1. Create a Web Service Endpoint Interface - annote it with @WebService, and @WebMethod
 2. Create a Web Service Endpoint Implementation
 3. Publish Without Server - Create a End point Publisher javax.xml.ws.Endpoint.publish("http://localhost:9999/ws/hello", new HelloWorldImpl());
 4. Publish with server - 
 4.1. Create a web service deployment descriptor - sun-jaxws.xml - it has all endpoints mention. provide details for name, implementation, url pattern
 4.2. web.xml
 4.2.1. add a listener com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener
 4.2.2. Add a Servlet - com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet - provide url mapping - it will handle requests for all services
 
 
 
.WHY SOAP BASED WEB SERVICE HAS MORE ABILITY TO BE SECURE THAN REST BASED
  SOAP security is well standardized through WS-SECURITY. Which has standards for end to end security. Irrespective of transport protocol.
  Three main features are 
  1. Integrity - Guidelines to sign soap messages to maintain integrity.
  2. Confidentiality - Guidelines to encrypt soap messages.
  
  For REst we have only transmission level security and basic  authentication. There are Token based authentications also.
